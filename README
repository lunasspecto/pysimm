pysimm

pysimm aims to be a Z-code interpreter in Python. It is the author's
first major project in Python. It is at a very early stage in development
and is likely to be vaporware.

Graphics are to be implemented using pyglet. Blorb support is provided by
Brandon Invergo's pyifbabel library (http://pyifbabel.invergo.net/).


You may use pysimm under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

As of yet, however, there isn't really anything to use. Development
has progressed only to checking the Z-code version and verifying a story
file's checksum.

Feature wishlist:
* Support for Z-code versions 1 through 8, including version 6
* Blorb graphics support
* Optional sound support throu AVbin
* Quetzal save file support
