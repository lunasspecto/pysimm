It is the author's\r\nfirst major project in Python. It is at a very early stage in development\r\nand is likely to be vaporware.\r\n\r\nGraphics are to be implemented using pyglet.\r\n\r\nYou may use pysimm under the terms of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\nAs of yet, however, there isn't really anything to use. Development\r\nhas progressed only to checking the Z-code version and verifying a story\r\nfile's checksum.\r\n\r\n### Feature wishlist:\r\n* Support for Z-code versions 1 through 8, including version 6\r\n* Blorb support, including blorb graphics\r\n* Optional sound support throu AVbin\r\n* Quetzal save file support\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
